# Christos Kapodistrias

## 🚀 AI Architect · Cloud Engineer · SaaS Builder  
Hands-on engineer with more than a decade of experience designing cloud-native systems and delivering advanced ML, LLM, and agentic AI solutions. I focus on building platforms where classical software engineering meets next-generation AI automation — enabling scalability, reliability, and intelligent decision-making at every layer.

My work includes forecasting engines, AI-augmented SaaS products, secure automation frameworks, and large-scale distributed systems across cloud and edge environments.

## 🔥 Current Focus
- **Agentic AI architectures:** planner–executor systems, multi-agent orchestration, AI memory, autonomous workflows  
- **LLM Infrastructure & RAG:** vector search, retrieval tuning, embeddings, caching, guardrails, safety  
- **Forecasting & Decision Systems:** hybrid ML + LLM reasoning, scenario modeling, explainable outputs  
- **Cloud & Edge Engineering:** serverless platforms, Kubernetes, distributed compute, high-performance APIs  
- **SaaS Architecture:** multi-tenant systems, identity & access layers, analytics infrastructure, automation
